# PatientBot Integration with ACS Voice Server

## âœ… Integration Complete!

The PatientBot class has been successfully integrated into the ACS voice server (`app.js`). Here's what was implemented:

## ðŸ”„ Integration Changes Made

### 1. **Added PatientBot Import**
```javascript
const { PatientBot } = require('./patientBot');
```

### 2. **Enhanced Call State Initialization**
- Added PatientBot instance creation when a call connects
- Transform patient data to match PatientBot expected format
- Initialize PatientBot with patient record and CosmosDB service

```javascript
// Transform patient data to match PatientBot expected format
const patientRecord = {
    patientName: patient.patientName,
    phoneNumber: patient.phoneNumber,
    age: patient.age || 'Unknown',
    primaryMedication: patient.medication || 'prescribed medication',
    // ... additional fields
};

// Initialize PatientBot for this call
const patientBot = new PatientBot(patientRecord, cosmosDbService);
```

### 3. **Replaced Static Greeting with AI-Generated Welcome**
- Initial greeting now comes from PatientBot's triage agent
- Personalized and context-aware based on patient data

### 4. **Upgraded Response Generation**
- Replaced simple rule-based responses with PatientBot intelligence
- Multi-agent conversation routing (triage â†’ adherence â†’ scheduling)
- SSML-formatted responses for optimal speech synthesis

```javascript
async function generateAgentResponse(userText, callState) {
    const { patientBot } = callState;
    const response = await patientBot.processMessage(userText);
    return response; // Already SSML-formatted
}
```

### 5. **Enhanced Call Summary and State Tracking**
- PatientBot conversation state included in call summaries
- Comprehensive tracking of conversation completion
- Better integration with CosmosDB for data persistence

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Now Available

### **Multi-Agent Conversation Flow**
1. **Triage Agent**: Greeting, identity confirmation, conversation setup
2. **Adherence Agent**: Medication compliance, side effects, education
3. **Scheduling Agent**: Appointment booking with calendar integration
4. **Post-Conversation**: Additional questions and graceful closure

### **Speech Optimization**
- SSML formatting with Jenny's voice (en-US-JennyNeural)
- Context-specific speech styles (emergency, adherence, scheduling)
- Enhanced pronunciation for medical terms and appointments

### **Azure Integration**
- Azure OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent responses
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Secure configuration management
- Integration with existing ACS Call Automation

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

1. **Call Initiated**: ACS receives incoming call or trigger
2. **PatientBot Created**: Instance initialized with patient data
3. **AI Greeting**: PatientBot generates personalized welcome message
4. **Conversation Flow**: User speech â†’ STT â†’ PatientBot â†’ SSML response â†’ TTS
5. **State Management**: PatientBot tracks conversation progress through agents
6. **Data Persistence**: Call results saved to CosmosDB with completion status

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
```
# Azure OpenAI (for PatientBot)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-openai-service.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-08-01-preview

# Azure Communication Services (existing)
ACS_CONNECTION_STRING=your-acs-connection-string
ACS_PHONE_NUMBER=your-acs-phone-number

# Speech Services (existing)
SPEECH_KEY=your-speech-key
SPEECH_REGION=eastus

# Microsoft Graph (for scheduling)
GRAPH_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
GRAPH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GRAPH_USER_ID=your-user-id
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Run the integration test:
```bash
node test-patientbot-integration.js
```

This will verify:
- PatientBot initialization
- Multi-agent conversation flow
- SSML response formatting
- State tracking functionality

## ðŸš€ What Happens Now

When a patient answers the phone, they will have a **full, intelligent conversation with Jenny** that includes:

1. **Personalized Greeting**: "Hello [Patient Name], this is Jenny from your healthcare team..."
2. **Medication Discussion**: Comprehensive adherence checking and education
3. **Appointment Scheduling**: Real calendar integration with Microsoft Graph
4. **Data Persistence**: All conversation data saved to CosmosDB

The voice server now provides **enterprise-grade healthcare conversation intelligence** powered by Azure OpenAI and integrated with your existing ACS infrastructure.

## ðŸ“ž Ready for Production

The integration is complete and ready for patient calls. The system will now:
- âœ… Provide intelligent, context-aware responses
- âœ… Guide patients through structured healthcare conversations  
- âœ… Handle appointment scheduling with real calendar systems
- âœ… Save comprehensive call data for healthcare team review
- âœ… Scale automatically with Azure's managed services

Your voice bot "Jenny" is now ready to have meaningful conversations with patients! ðŸŽ‰
